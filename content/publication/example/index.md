abstract: A variation packets delay which is also called packet jitter causes packet loss and delay. When jitter happens to stream video, users suffer an annoying freezes which results in user unpleasant.  To evaluate the performance of EDD in a real-world wireless network system. We implement EDD algorithms on Extendable Mobile Ad-hoc Network Emulator (EMANE) to take virtual field tests. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a low-complexity queue scheduling module in both single-hop multi-server systems using C/C++. We also show an efficient debug method in EMANE development. Our emulation results demonstrate the EDD policy achieves over 1000x reduction in jitter probability compared to the commonly used FCFS policy.
